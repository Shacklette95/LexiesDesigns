            <p>This is a website to show my sister that i can build a website for her to sell her art. She has come up with all of these off the top of her head. They were all patterned and designed free-hand, even though almost all the designes originated from tv shows, or movies. Yes, this is mostly to brag about my sister, but that is what brothers are for.</p>
